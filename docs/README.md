# MwalaPay Backend

## Overview
MwalaPay is a modern digital payment platform designed to simplify how people store, transfer, and use money. The backend powers a secure financial infrastructure that enables users to manage wallets, perform transactions, connect bank accounts and mobile money services, and make online payments — all within a single ecosystem.

Built with a **ledger-first architecture**, MwalaPay ensures that every financial transaction is traceable, auditable, and secure.


## Why MwalaPay Matters

Many existing payment systems are fragmented. Users often face:

- High transaction fees
